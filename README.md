# AAS 1100 Mapping/Community Final Project

Our final project for AAS 1100 is to find and explain Asian communities in Ithaca by creating a map of Asian communities in Ithaca using census data. In this repo, we built a web scraping tool to easily and rapidly collect census data from ancestry.com We also built some data visualizations to view interesting trends and clusters in our collected data.
